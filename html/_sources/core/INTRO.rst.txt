Objective
=========

The objective of the oneAPI Unified Runtime is to provide a unified interface to
device agnostic runtimes such as DPC++ across a wide variety of software platforms. The unified
runtime provides extensibility where new backends can be developed to support
new software platforms and devices. Software platforms can be enumerated through the interface
and used to provide best experience. The interface will semantically align with the Level Zero
Driver interface and support native platform access.

Fundamentals
============

The following section provides fundamentals of the API design.
For more detailed information, refer to the programming guides and detailed specification pages.

The repository for Unified Runtime can be found here:

* `oneapi-src/unified-runtime <https://github.com/oneapi-src/unified-runtime>`_

Terminology
-----------

This specification uses key words based on `RFC2119 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt>`__ to indicate requirement level.
In particular, the following words are used to describe the actions of an implementation of this specification:

  - **May** - the word *may*, or the adjective *optional*, mean that conforming implementations are permitted to, but need not behave as described.
  - **Should** - the word *should*, or the adjective *recommended*, mean that there could be reasons for an implementation to deviate from the behavior described, but that such deviation should be avoided.
  - **Must** - the word *must*, or the term *required* or *shall*, mean that the behavior described is an absolute requirement of the specification.


Versioning
----------

There are multiple versions that should be used by the application to determine compatibility:

**Platform Version** - this is the version of the API supported by the platform.

  - This is typically used to determine if the device supports the minimum set of APIs required by the application
  - There is a single 32-bit value that represents an entire collection of APIs
  - The value is encoded with 16-bit Major and 16-bit Minor parts
  - Major version increment consist of modified functionality, including deprecate features, and may break backwards-compatibility
  - Minor version increment consist of additional functionality, including promoted extensions, and must retain backwards-compatibility
  - The value is determined from calling :ref:`urPlatformGetApiVersion`
  - The value returned will be the minimum of the :ref:`ur-api-version-t` supported by the device and known by the driver

Error Handling
--------------

The following design philosophies are adopted to reduce Host-side overhead:

  - By default, the driver implementation may not perform parameter validation of any kind

    + This should be handled by validation layer(s)

  - By default, neither the driver nor device provide may provide any protection against the following:

    + Invalid API programming
    + Invalid function arguments
    + Function infinite loops or recursions
    + Synchronization primitive deadlocks
    + Non-visible memory access by the Host or device
    + Non-resident memory access by the device

  - The driver implementation is **not** required to perform API validation of any kind

    + The driver should ensure well-behaved applications are not burdened with the overhead needed for non-behaving applications
    + Unless otherwise specified, the driver behavior is undefined when APIs are improperly used
    + For debug purposes, API validation can be enabled via the loader's validation layer(s)

  - All API functions return :ref:`ur-result-t`

    + This enumeration contains error codes for the Unified Runtime APIs and validation layers
    + This allows for a consistent pattern on the application side for catching errors; especially when validation layer(s) are enabled

Multithreading and Concurrency
------------------------------

The following design philosophies are adopted in order to maximize Host thread concurrency:

  - APIs are free-threaded when the runtime's object handle is different.

    + the runtime should avoid thread-locks for these API calls

  - APIs are not thread-safe when the runtime's object handle is the same, except when explicitly noted.

    + the application must ensure multiple threads do not enter an API when the handle is the same

  - APIs are not thread-safe with other APIs that use the same runtime's object handle

    + the application must ensure multiple threads do not enter these APIs when the handle is the same

In general, the API is designed to be free-threaded rather than thread-safe.
This provides multithreaded applications with complete control over both threading and locks.
This also eliminates unnecessary runtime overhead for single threaded applications and/or very low latency usages.

The exception to this rule is that all memory allocation APIs are thread-safe since they allocate from a single global memory pool.
If an application needs lock-free memory allocation, then it could allocate a per-thread pool and implement its own sub-allocator.

An application is in direct control over all Host thread creation and usage.
The runtime should never implicitly create threads.
If there is a need for an implementation to use a background thread, then that thread should be created and provided by the application.

Each API function must document details on the multithreading requirements for that call.

The primary usage-model enabled by these rules is:

  - multiple, simultaneous threads may operate on independent driver objects with no implicit thread-locks
  - driver object handles may be passed between and used by multiple threads with no implicit thread-locks

Application Binary Interface
----------------------------

The Unified Runtime C APIs are provided to applications by a shared import library.
C/C++ applications must include "ur_api.h" and link with "ur_api.lib".
The Unified Runtime C Device-Driver Interfaces (DDIs) are provided to the import library by the shared loader or runtime and driver libraries.
C/C++ loaders and drivers must include "ur_ddi.h".

The implementation of these libraries must use the default Application Binary Interface (ABI) of the standard C compiler for the platform.
An ABI in this context means the size, alignment, and layout of C data types; the procedure calling convention.
and the naming convention for shared library symbols corresponding to C functions. The ABI is backward-compatible
for API minor version increments such as adding new functions, appending new enumerators, and using reserved
bits in bitfields. ABI is not guaranteed to be backward-compatible for API major version increments such as
modifying existing function signatures and structures, removing functions and structures, etc.

On platforms where Unified Runtime is provided as a shared library, library symbols beginning with "ur", "urt" or "urs"
and followed by a digit or uppercase letter are reserved for use by the implementation.
Applications which use Unified Runtime must not provide definitions of these symbols.
This allows the Unified Runtime shared library to be updated with additional symbols for new API versions or extensions without causing symbol conflicts with existing applications.

Tracing
---------------------

Unified Runtime loader implements tracing support through the `XPTI framework <https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/sycl/xptifw/doc/XPTI_Framework.md>`__.

   :header-rows: 1

   * - Trace Point Type
     - Parameter Description
     -  Metadata
   * - `function_with_args_begin`
     - | **trace_type**: `xpti::trace_point_type_t::function_with_args_begin` that marks the beginning of a function

       | **user_data**: A pointer to `function_with_args_t` object, that includes function ID, name, arguments, and return value.
     - None

Logging
---------------------

Logging in UR is handled by loggers which can be set for each library separately. There are several levels of logging: *debug*, *info*, *warning*, and *error*.
The level of logging determines what messages will be printed, ie. the level set to *warning* means all messages at levels *warning* and *error* will be printed.
By default, no messages are printed.

By default, there is a guarantee that *error* messages are flushed immediately. One can change this behavior to flush on lower-level messages.

Loggers redirect messages to *stdout*, *stderr*, or a file (default: *stderr*).

All of these logging options can be set with **UR_LOG_LOADER** and **UR_LOG_NULL** environment variables described in the **Environment Variables** section below.
Both of these environment variables have the same syntax for setting logger options:

  "[level:debug|info|warning|error];[flush:<debug|info|warning|error>];[output:stdout|stderr|file,<path>]"

  * level - a log level, meaning that only messages from this level and above are printed,
            possible values, from the lowest level to the highest one: *debug*, *info*, *warning*, *error*,
  * flush - a flush level, meaning that messages at this level and above are guaranteed to be flushed immediately,
            possible values are the same as above,
  * output - indicates where messages should be printed,
             possible values are: *stdout*, *stderr* and *file*,
             when providing a *file* output option, a *<path>* is required

  .. note::
    For output to file, a path to the file have to be provided after a comma, like in the example above. The path has to exist, file will be created if not existing.
    All these three logger options are optional. The defaults are set when options are not provided in the environment variable.
    Options have to be separated with `;`, option names, and their values with `:`. Additionally, when providing *file* output, the keyword *file* and a path to a file
    have to be separated by `,`.

An example of an environment variable for setting up the loader library logger with logging level set to *info*, flush level set to *warning*, and output set to
the ``out.log`` file::

  UR_LOG_LOADER="level:info;flush:warning;output:file,out.log"

An example of an environment variable for setting up the null adapter library with logging level set to *warning* and output set to stdout::

  UR_LOG_NULL="level:warning;output:stdout"

Adapter Discovery
---------------------
UR is capable of discovering adapter libraries in the following ways in the listed order:

  - Search in paths to the adapters set in `UR_ADAPTERS_FORCE_LOAD` environment variable.

    + All other adapter discovery methods are disabled when this environment variable is used.

  - Search in directories specified in `UR_ADAPTERS_SEARCH_PATH` environment variable.

  - Leave adapter discovery for the OS.

    + This method is disabled on Windows.

    + If on Linux, use the shared library discovery mechanism (see **ld.so**(8) for details).

  - Search in directory at the UR loader location.

Currently, UR looks for these adapter libraries:

  - ur_adapter_level_zero

For more information about the usage of mentioned environment variables see `Environment Variables`_ section.

Layers
---------------------
UR comes with a mechanism that allows various API intercept layers to be enabled, either through the API or with an environment variable (see `Environment Variables`_).
Layers currently included with the runtime are as follows:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Layer Name
     - Description
   * - UR_LAYER_PARAMETER_VALIDATION
     - Enables non-adapter-specific parameter validation (e.g. checking for null values).
   * - UR_LAYER_LEAK_CHECKING
     - Performs some leak checking for API calls involving object creation/destruction.
   * - UR_LAYER_FULL_VALIDATION
     - Enables UR_LAYER_PARAMETER_VALIDATION and UR_LAYER_LEAK_CHECKING.
   * - UR_LAYER_TRACING
     - Enables the XPTI tracing layer, see Tracing_ for more detail.

Environment Variables
---------------------

Specific environment variables can be set to control the behavior of unified runtime or enable certain features.

.. envvar:: UR_LOG_LOADER

   Holds parameters for setting Unified Runtime loader logging. The syntax is described in the Logging_ section.

.. envvar:: UR_LOG_NULL

   Holds parameters for setting Unified Runtime null adapter logging. The syntax is described in the Logging_ section.

.. envvar:: UR_LOG_VALIDATION

   Holds parameters for setting Unified Runtime validation logging. The syntax is described in the Logging_ section.

.. envvar:: UR_ADAPTERS_FORCE_LOAD

   Holds a comma-separated list of library paths used by the loader for adapter discovery. By setting this value you can
   force the loader to use specific adapter implementations from the libraries provided.

   .. note::

    This environment variable should be used for development and debugging only.

   .. note::

    All other adapter discovery methods are disabled when this environment variable is used.

.. envvar:: UR_ADAPTERS_SEARCH_PATH

   Holds a comma-separated list of directory paths used for adapter discovery. By setting this value you can extend
   the list of directories the loader searches for adapter implementations.

   .. note::

    The usage of colons and semicolons is allowed only inside '' or "" quote signs.

   .. note::

    This environment variable is ignored when :envvar:`UR_ADAPTERS_FORCE_LOAD` environment variable is used.

.. envvar:: UR_ENABLE_LAYERS

    Holds a comma-separated list of layers to enable in addition to any specified via ``urInit``.

    .. note::

    See the Layers_ section for details of the layers currently included in the runtime.

Service identifiers
---------------------

Unified Runtime may create logs containing Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
in the form of unique device identifiers during its use.
This capability is turned off by default.
Please refer to the Logging_ and `Environment Variables`_ sections above for more information.
